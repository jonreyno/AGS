# AGS for OSX

Uses a modified Allegro 4 library which sets up an offscreen buffer that the game renders to. And then blits that to texture memory in the OpenGL graphics hardware and finally renders that texture to screen.

Supports Mac OS X 10.7+ (tested through 10.11).  

This port was initially done by Edward Rudd for providing Gemini Rue in a Humble Bundle.
